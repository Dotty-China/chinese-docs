title: Dropped: Macros
---

The previous, experimental macro system has been dropped. Instead,
there is a cleaner, more restricted system based on two complementary
concepts: `inline` and `meta`.

`inline` has been [implemented](../inline.md) in Dotty.

`meta` is worked on in the separate [Scalameta](http://scalameta.org) project
