title: "Multiversal Equality"
---

Previously, Scala had universal equality: Two values of any types
could be compared with each other with `==` and `!=`. This came from
the fact that `==` and `!=` are implemented in terms of Java's
`equals` method, which can also compare values of any two reference
types.

Universal equality is convenient but also dangerous since it
undermines type safety. Say you have an erroneous program where
a value `y` has type `S` instead of the expected type `T`.

    val x = ... // of type T
    val y = ... // of type S, but should be T
    x == y      // typechecks, will always yield false

If all you do with `y` is compare it to other values of type `T`, the program will
typecheck but probably give unexpected results.

Multiversal equality is an opt-in way to make universal equality
safer. The idea is that by declaring an `implicit` value one can
restrict the types that are legal in comparisons. The example above
would not typecheck if an implicit was declared like this for type `T`
(or an analogous one for type `S`):

    implicit def eqT: Eq[T, T] = Eq

This definition effectively says that value of type `T` can (only) be
compared with `==` or `!=` to other values of type `T`. The definition
is used only for type checking; it has no significance for runtime
behavior, since `==` always maps to `equals` and `!=` always maps to
the negation of `equals`. The right hand side of the definition is a value
that has any `Eq` instance as its type. Here is the definition of class
`Eq` and its companion object:

    package scala
    import annotation.implicitNotFound

    @implicitNotFound("Values of types ${L} and ${R} cannot be compared with == or !=")
    sealed trait Eq[-L, -R]

    object Eq extends Eq[Any, Any]

One can have several `Eq` instances for a type. For example, the four
definitions below make values of type `A` and type `B` comparable with
each other, but not comparable to anything else:

    implicit def eqA : Eq[A, A] = Eq
    implicit def eqB : Eq[B, B] = Eq
    implicit def eqAB: Eq[A, B] = Eq
    implicit def eqBA: Eq[B, A] = Eq

(As usual, the names of the implicit definitions don't matter, we have
chosen `eqA`, ..., `eqBA` only for illustration).

The `scala.Eq` object defines a number of `Eq` implicits that make
values of types `String`, `Boolean` and `Unit` only comparable to
values of the same type. They also make numbers only comparable to
other numbers, sequences only comparable to other
sequences and sets only comparable to other sets.

There's also a "fallback" instance named `eqAny` that allows comparisons
over all types that do not themselves have an `Eq` instance.  `eqAny` is
defined as follows:

    def eqAny[L, R]: Eq[L, R] = Eq

Even though `eqAny` is not declared implicit, the compiler will still
construct an `eqAny` instance as answer to an implicit search for the
type `Eq[L, R]`, provided that neither `L` nor `R` have `Eq` instances
defined on them.

The primary motivation for having `eqAny` is backwards compatibility,
if this is of no concern one can disable `eqAny` by enabling the language
feature `strictEquality`. As for all language features this can be either
done with an import

    import scala.language.strictEquality

or with a command line option `-language:strictEquality`.

All `enum` types also come with `Eq` instances that make values of the
`enum` type comparable only to other values of that `enum` type.

The precise rules for equality checking are as follows.

 1. A comparison using `x == y` or `x != y` between values `x: T` and `y: U`
    is legal if either `T` and `U` are the same, or one of the types is a subtype
    of the "lifted" version of the other type, or an implicit value of type `scala.Eq[T, U]` is found.
    See the [description on Github](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/1247) for
    a definition of lifting.

 2. The usual rules for implicit search apply also to `Eq` instances,
    with one modification: An instance of `scala.Eq.eqAny[T, U]` is
    constructed if neither `T` nor `U` have a reflexive `Eq`
    instance themselves. Here, a type `T` has a reflexive `Eq`
    instance if the implicit search for `Eq[T, T]` succeeds
    and constructs an instance different from `eqAny`.

    Here _lifting_ a type `S` means replacing all references to  abstract types
    in covariant positions of `S` by their upper bound, and to replacing
    all refinement types in covariant positions of `S` by their parent.
